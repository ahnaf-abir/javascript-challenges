Thing I have learnt from this lesson:

1. transform can rotate an element by degrees, e.g. 90, 180.
2. transform origin 100% keeps the element one sided, meaning only one side will move with the given degrees.
3. elements can be directly styled by setting them to const and calling _.style in a function.
