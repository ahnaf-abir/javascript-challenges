Typically, we have to reload a page to render it's changed css. 
In this lesson, I have learnt to control and update css items using javascript without reloading the page.
1. Set a variable name in css, `--base, --spacing` etc and set some values with these in the root. 
2. refer to those variable and set with a property, for e.x. `padding: var(--spacing)`
3. All css elements and classes can be set with same variables. As a result, on updating the variable, updates all elements as well.

4. Select all inputs using document.querySelectorAll.
5. Add eventListener('change') and ('mousemove') with a function to update the vars.
6. In the function, use document.documentElement.style.setProperty to set the changed value relevant to the right property.
