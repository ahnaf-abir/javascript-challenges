Things I learnt from this lesson:
1. Flex box can be oriented using flex-direction
2. flex: 1 means content will have qually distributed width
3. transform: translateY/translateX() with a value of -100 to 100% can move the item in y and x direction respectively. Can be added to a class to get called by javascript.
